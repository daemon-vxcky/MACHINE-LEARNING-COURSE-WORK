# 🧠 Machine Learning Algorithms with Scikit-learn

This repository contains hands-on implementations of a wide range of **Machine Learning (ML)** algorithms using the powerful [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/) library. It is created as part of my coursework and serves as a practical guide to understand and apply fundamental ML techniques.

## 📚 Overview

The goal of this project is to **explore, implement, and practice** nearly all major machine learning algorithms, grouped by learning paradigms. The repository is designed for students, educators, and enthusiasts looking to gain practical experience with:

* Supervised Learning
* Unsupervised Learning
* Model Evaluation & Tuning
* Dimensionality Reduction
* Ensemble Methods
* Pipeline Construction
* And more...

All code is written in **Python**, using **scikit-learn (sklearn)** as the primary library for implementation and experimentation.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is part of my academic coursework and is intended for:

* Reinforcing theoretical ML concepts through implementation
* Gaining hands-on practice with standard ML workflows
* Building a reusable reference for future ML projects

---

## 📌 Notes

* All implementations are done **exclusively using scikit-learn**.
* Code is written for educational purposes; performance optimizations and production-readiness are secondary.
* Contributions (e.g., new algorithms, improvements) are welcome!
