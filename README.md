# 🧠 Machine Learning Algorithms with Scikit-learn

This repository contains hands-on implementations of a wide range of **Machine Learning (ML)** algorithms using the powerful [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/) library. It is created as part of my coursework and serves as a practical guide to understand and apply fundamental ML techniques.

## 📚 Overview

The goal of this project is to **explore, implement, and practice** nearly all major machine learning algorithms, grouped by learning paradigms. The repository is designed for students, educators, and enthusiasts looking to gain practical experience with:

* Supervised Learning
* Unsupervised Learning
* Model Evaluation & Tuning
* Dimensionality Reduction
* Ensemble Methods
* Pipeline Construction
* And more...

All code is written in **Python**, using **scikit-learn (sklearn)** as the primary library for implementation and experimentation.

## 🛠️ Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ML-with-sklearn.git
cd ML-with-sklearn
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can also set up a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 How to Run

Each script is standalone and can be run independently. For example:

```bash
python supervised/decision_trees.py
```

Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed and required datasets are either generated or loaded via `sklearn.datasets`.

---

## 📦 Dependencies

All requirements are listed in `requirements.txt`. Key libraries include:

* `scikit-learn`
* `numpy`
* `pandas`
* `matplotlib` / `seaborn` (if used for visualizations)

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is part of my academic coursework and is intended for:

* Reinforcing theoretical ML concepts through implementation
* Gaining hands-on practice with standard ML workflows
* Building a reusable reference for future ML projects

---

## 📌 Notes

* All implementations are done **exclusively using scikit-learn**.
* Code is written for educational purposes; performance optimizations and production-readiness are secondary.
* Contributions (e.g., new algorithms, improvements) are welcome!
